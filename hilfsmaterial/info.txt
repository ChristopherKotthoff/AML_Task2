ML Stages:
1. finding peaks (auto regression?) -> check performance ... periodicity?
2. using the library from biosppy to find some of the features
3. outlier detection
4. feature selection
5. classification algos (attention: inverted features?)


keep in mind:
- class imbalance
- there are no "features"
- what does normalization mean?
- investigate: can signal really be reduced to one representative heartbeat? (reconstruction) or does the whole signal count (e.g. arithmia)
- changing the distance between peaks?
- bins? - lower sampling rate (median, mean, ...)
- wavelet transform?
- doing classification on fourier transform?
- different signal lengths


Pipeline definitions: -> diagnostics (.json)?
