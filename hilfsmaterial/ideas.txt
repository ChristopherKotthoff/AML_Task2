- debrief aka. what went wrong in project 1?
- how to split work this time (stages, approaches)
- there are no "features": how to normalize/standardize?
- investigate: can signal really be reduced to one representative heartbeat? (reconstruction)
- what does the f1 score tell us about work prioritization?
- how to handle class imbalance?
- look for pca equivalent algorithm (unsupervised learning without y)
